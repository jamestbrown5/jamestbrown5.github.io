## Research Journals

## Cataloging the journalism influencing my current perspective of society, politics, the world around me.  

#### The Ezra Klein show is a deep dive into all kinds of topics and information about the world around us. Every episode has shifted my perspective and given me new language to talk about and understand my place in the universe. I know, it sounds heavy but if you are like me and you like to learn new things from experts in the field, you will definately enjoy this show.

### I am just getting into this show so I am not sure how long this will be apart of the list. Dylan Matthews is a self-professed Effective Altruist and as such his approach to the world starts from a place of how can we (humanity) most effectively improve the lives of the most people. Its an ideal I wasn't to familiar with until I began listening to this cast but it has definitely capttured my imagination. I am enjoying it so far, kinda trippy but I like it.

### The Weeds is funny. These hosts are great at teasing apart national issues and these hosts go deep into the weeds.

## Projects

### Raincross Underground  

![Raincross Underground Babyhead Image]({{site:url}}/images/raincross-underground.jpg)  

Begun for my Digital Libraries class with John Walsh, [Raincross Underground](http://raincrossunderground.omeka.net/) is an [Omeka](http://omeka.org/) site with items from a Riverside, CA creative scene that existed during the early 2000s. It includes images, sounds, and TEI markup of songs from a band I was in.

### Bloomington City Directories Finding Guide

![Bloomington City Directories Finding Guide]({{site:url}}/images/bloomington-city-directories.jpg)

Making the [Bloomington City Directories Finding Guide](http://libraries.iub.edu/guide-bloomington-city-directories) began with an inventory of the various directories held by the Herman B Wells Library. Then I had to decide the best way to organize and present this information to our patrons. Finally, I wrote the html code to inclue the guide on the website.  

### Indiana Historical Maps Digital Collection

![IHMDC]({{site:url}}/images/indiana-historic-maps-screenshot.jpg)

Although the work of digitizing this collection began before I arrived at the Government Documents, Maps, and Microform Services department, the [Indiana Historical Maps Digital Collection](http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/images/splash.htm?scope=images/VAC3073) project took the bulk of my first year there. A large part of my role as the Maps Graduate Assistant involved digitizing and adding maps to this collection, as well as determining, adding, and standardizing appropriate metadata like tags that relevant researchers would find useful throughout the collection.
