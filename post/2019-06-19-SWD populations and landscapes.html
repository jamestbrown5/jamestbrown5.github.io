Management practices are also driven by surrounding landscapes. Landscape heterogeneity can impact pests in perrinial systems via spill over as insects move between managed and unmanaged aras to complete thier life cycle. Perrinial systems cannot be reset. higher landscape diversity has been shown to increase insect populatios at the large scale. THe challenge in local systems is difficult because of the challenges of monitoring pest-prey interactions. SWD is one of these pests where more information about this interaction is needed because few natural enemies have been found.</h2>
