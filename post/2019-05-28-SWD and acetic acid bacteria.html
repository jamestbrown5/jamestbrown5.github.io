<h3 id="context"><strong>Context</strong></h3>
<p>Acetic acid bacteria are ubiquitous in nature and symbiotic relationships between these bacteria and insect orders have been extablished. These bacteria occur in the miidgut of SWD. Previous studies have noted advantages for insects that harbor these bacteria in their midgut, which includes; improving digestive opportunities, larval development, immune homeostasis, increased life span, defense from other microorganisms, and celll to cell communication</p>
<p>Other bacteria have been shown to produce attractive volatiles. These hidden players (yeast, fungi, bacteria) have also been implicated in affecting the interaction between insects and their hosts. These researchers sought to characterize the relative attractivenbess of SWD to multiple acetic acid bacteria using a two way olfactometer. Next the VOC profiles of bacteria was characterized</p>
<h3 id="methods"><strong>Methods</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Colonies and cultures</li>
<li>Field caught SWD, acetic acid bacteria isolated from a lab</li>
<li><em>2-way olfactometer assay</em> 6-Bacteria cultures in sterile MA liquid broth at specific cell concentrations, Olfactometer assay method by Mazzetto et al. 2015, 2-10 day old females used</li>
<li><em>VOC analysis</em> Sample of solid MA and bacteria plus NaCl, bipolymer spme, compounds identified by library match, then authenticated by RI of C5-C18 alkanes, 6 reps of each strain and control (three at 24h and three at 48h)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="results"><strong>Results</strong></h3>
<p>Friedman ANOVA tests the differences in fly response between, microbe, control and no choice. Wilcoxon test the effect of the control vs the microbe. Each assay resulted in a choice of crontrol or microbe except SWD vs K. hansenii at 48h of bacteria growth. SWD preferred G. oxydans, G kanchanaburiensis, and K. saccharivorans at 24h and 48h of bacteria growth.</p>

<h3 id="discussion"><strong>Discussion</strong></h3>
<p>THere was variation in the response of the SWD to the isolates. Two of the microbes that had the largest effect on SWD response (Gluconobacter and K. saccharivorans) should be considered for future testing. More information about symbioants is needed.</p>
