Insects that feed in nutrient poor environments (aphids etc.) microbes provide key nutrients. For example, tsetse fly microbes produce vitamins like B for the fly. D. melanogaster lab flies have been shown to have a small yet important microbe community which has been shown to promote development and negatively impact longevity. D. suzukii is a relevent model to study microbiome affects because these insects spend their larval lives developing in fruit.</h3>
