Our current understanding of biofilms is limited but we do know they tend to be composed of macromolecules: polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids produced by the cell. B. subtilis makes a biofilm in liquid by changing its growth pattern from single cell to form a long chain of individual microbes that create a pellicle.</h2>
