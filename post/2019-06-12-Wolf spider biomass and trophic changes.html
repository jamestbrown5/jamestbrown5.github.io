There is general aggreement that climate change will affect species interactions. There are few studies on how climate-modified trophic cascades will change ecosystem functioning. Change in the dynamics of communities do influence ecosystem function. One ecosystem and trophic interaction that is quickly changing is the above and below ground trophic interactions of the artic.</h3>

Fast warming is increasing microbe respiration in the soil, turning the artic into a C source, and increasing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. Little work has been done to understand how belowground consumers (microbes) and their consumers will effect ecosystem function as each of these two groups is affected by climate change.</h3>

The biomass, wolf spiders are the most abundant predator in the artic. These spiders in temperate and artic environments are generalists and in those temperate regions these spiders indirectly effect the ecosystem. Recently, these spiders have been shown to prey on the detritivores (collembola) suggesting a indirect effect of spiders on nutrient cycling and decomposition</h3>
